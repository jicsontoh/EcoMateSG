# EcoMateSG
EcoMateSG is a simple and easy to use mobile application that offer features to help users make environmentally conscious choices and adopt a more sustainable lifestyle. 

EcoMateSG seek to track and calculate how much carbon emission the user can reduce when making environmentally conscious decisions such as using their own recycle bag and not use plastic bags.
The app then stores these information and converts them to a point system which the user can keep track of.

This application is available for both android and ios devices.

Some of the features include:
- Reducing use of plastic bags
- Encouraging the use of public transport instead of private vehicles

## Future Implementations
We understand that it may be difficult to change people's lifestyle habits and choices hence we hope to partner with the government or sponsors to reward people through the point system whereby users can exchange the points for vouchers which they can use for groceries or to top up their public transport card.
We also hope to roll out more fun and easy to use features that people can incorporate into their lifestyle.
