## Future Implementations
We understand that it may be difficult to change people's lifestyle habits and choices hence we hope to partner with the government or sponsors to reward and incentivise people through a point system while tracking their carbon emission.
We also hope to roll out more fun and easy to use features that people can incorporate into their lifestyle.
